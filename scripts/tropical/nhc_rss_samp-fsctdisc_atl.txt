 Hurricane Dorian Discussion Number  33
 NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052019

 Air Force and NOAA reconnaissance planes penetrated the distinct
 eye of Dorian, and found that the hurricane has become extremely
 intense with a stadium effect in the eye. The NOAA plane reported a
 peak flight-level wind of 159 kt, while the SFMR from both planes
 have measured winds between 155 and 170 kt.  A dropsonde from the
 NOAA plane measured a wind gust of 176 kt at the surface. A blend of
 these measurements yield to an initial intensity of 155 kt, making
 Dorian the strongest hurricane on record in the northwestern
 Bahamas.
 
 For the next few days, Dorian should experience some fluctuations in
 intensity, and in addition to eyewall replacement cyclone, the
 interaction with the northwestern Bahamas should weaken the
 hurricane slightly. After 3 days, as Dorian moves northward along
 or offshore of southeast United States coast, the shear is forecast
 to increase, resulting in a more distinct gradual weakening.
 
 Reconnaissance plane and satellite fixes indicate that Dorian, as
 anticipated, has slowed down and is moving toward the west or 270
 degrees at 6 kt. The steering currents are collapsing and Dorian is
 expected to slow down even more, prolonging its catastrophic effects
 in the northwestern Bahamas. The NHC forecast calls for a slow west
 to west-northwest motion during the next 48 hours, with a turn to
 the north and an increase in forward speed as the mid-level trough
 along the eastern United States deepens and becomes the dominant
 steering feature. The current forecast is only a few miles west of
 the previous one and is basically on top of the multi-model
 consensus. Both the deterministic and consensus tracks have shown
 the usual variability to the right or to the left from run to run,
 but the overall trend is for the hurricane to turn northward
 offshore but very close to the Florida peninsula.
 
 Given the uncertainty in the track forecast and the anticipated
 increase in size of the hurricane, a Hurricane Watch and Storm
 Surge Watch have been issued for a portion of the east Florida
 coast. It is emphasized that although the official track forecast
 does not show landfall, users should not focus on the exact track. A
 small deviation to the left of the track could bring the intense
 core of the hurricane its dangerous winds closer to or onto the
 coast.
 
 Key Messages:
 
 1. A prolonged period of catastrophic winds and storm surge will
 affect the Abaco Islands today. Everyone there should take immediate
 shelter and not venture into the eye. These catastrophic conditions
 are likely on Grand Bahama Island later today or tonight, and
 efforts to protect life and property there should be rushed to
 completion.
 
 2. Storm surge and hurricane watches and tropical storm warnings are
 in effect for portions of the Florida east coast. Life-threatening
 storm surge and dangerous hurricane-force winds are possible along
 portions of the Florida east coast through mid-week, as only a
 slight deviation to the left of the official forecast would bring
 the core of Dorian near or over the coast. Residents should listen
 to advice given by local emergency officials.
 
 3. There is an increasing likelihood of strong winds and dangerous
 storm surge along the coasts of Georgia, South Carolina, and North
 Carolina later this week. Residents in these areas should continue
 to monitor the progress of Dorian.
 
 4. Heavy rains, capable of producing life-threatening flash floods,
 are possible over northern portions of the Bahamas and coastal
 sections of the southeast and lower mid-Atlantic regions of the
 United States through late this week.
