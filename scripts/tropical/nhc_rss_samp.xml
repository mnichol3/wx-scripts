Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 PM EDT Sun Sep 1 2019<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane<br/>
Dorian, located over the Abacos Islands.<br/>
<br/>
A broad area of low pressure centered near the Cabo Verde Islands is<br/>
producing a large area of showers and thunderstorms. This system is<br/>
showing signs of becoming better organized, and environmental<br/>
conditions appear conducive for additional development during the<br/>
next several days. A tropical depression is likely to form by the<br/>
middle of the week while the system moves generally northwestward<br/>
across the eastern tropical Atlantic Ocean. Heavy rainfall is<br/>
possible over portions of the southern Cabo Verde Islands during the<br/>
next day or so, and interests on those islands should monitor the<br/>
progress of this system.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...60 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...70 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Another broad area of low pressure is located over the south-central<br/>
Gulf of Mexico. This disturbance continues to produce widespread<br/>
disorganized showers. Some gradual development of this system is<br/>
possible during the next few days while it moves slowly westward<br/>
across the southern and southwestern Gulf of Mexico toward the coast<br/>
of Mexico.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...30 percent.<br/>
<br/>
A trough of low pressure is located several hundred miles<br/>
south-southeast of Bermuda.  Although the associated shower and<br/>
thunderstorm activity is showing some signs of organization, the<br/>
system does not currently have a closed surface circulation. Some<br/>
gradual development of this disturbance is possible during the next<br/>
few days while it moves slowly northward or north-northwestward.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...30 percent.<br/>

within the watch area.  A watch is typically issued 48 hours
before the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force
winds, conditions that make outside preparations difficult or
dangerous.

A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected within the warning area within 36 hours.

A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.

Interests elsewhere along the east coast of Florida should continue
to monitor the progress of Dorian, as additional watches or
warnings may be required later today.

For storm information specific to your area in the United States,
including possible inland watches and warnings, please monitor
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast
office. For storm information specific to your area outside of the
United States, please monitor products issued by your national
meteorological service.


DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM EDT (1800 UTC), the extremely distinct eye of Hurricane
Dorian was located near latitude 26.5 North, longitude 77.1 West.
Dorian is moving toward the west near 7 mph (11 km/h). A slower
westward motion should continue for the next day or two, followed by
a gradual turn toward the northwest.  On this track, the core of
extremely dangerous Hurricane Dorian will continue to pound Great
Abaco today and the move near or over Grand Bahama Island tonight
and Monday. The hurricane should move closer to the Florida east
coast late Monday through Tuesday night.

Maximum sustained winds are near 185 mph (295 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Dorian is a extremely dangerous category 5 hurricane on the
Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.  Some fluctuations in intensity
are likely, and Dorian is expected to remain a catastrophic
hurricane during the next few days.

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140
miles (220 km).

The minimum central pressure measured by both NOAA and Air Force
reconnaissance plane was 911 mb (26.90 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Catastrophic hurricane conditions are occurring in the Abacos
Islands and will spread across Grand Bahama Island later today and
tonight. Do not venture out into the eye, as winds will suddenly
increase as the eye passes.

Hurricane conditions are possible within the hurricane watch area in
Florida by late Monday or early Tuesday.

Tropical storm conditions are expected within the tropical storm
warning area on Monday and Tuesday.

Tropical storm conditions are possible within the tropical storm
watch area by Monday night.

STORM SURGE:  A life-threatening storm surge will raise water levels
by as much as 18 to 23 feet above normal tide levels in areas of
onshore winds on the Abaco Islands and Grand Bahama Island.  Near
the coast, the surge will be accompanied by large and destructive
waves.

The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the tide will cause
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters
moving inland from the shoreline. The water could reach the
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...

Volusia/Brevard County Line to Jupiter Inlet FL...4 to 7 ft
North of Deerfield Beach to Jupiter Inlet FL...2 to 4 ft

The surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
Surge-related flooding depends on the how close the center of
Dorian comes to the Florida east coast, and can vary greatly over
short distances.  For information specific to your area, please see
products issued by your local National Weather Service forecast
office.

RAINFALL:  Dorian is expected to produce the following rainfall
totals through late this week:

Northwestern Bahamas...12 to 24 inches, isolated 30 inches.
Coastal Carolinas...5 to 10 inches, isolated 15 inches.
Central Bahamas and the Atlantic Coast from the Florida peninsula
through Georgia...2 to 4 inches, isolated 6 inches.

This rainfall may cause life-threatening flash floods.

SURF:  Large swells are already affecting east-facing shores of the
Bahamas, the Florida east coast, and will spread northward along the
southeastern United States coast during the next few days.  These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.


NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 PM EDT.

Hourly Tropical Cyclone Update statements will begin at 300 PM EDT.

Hurricane Dorian Discussion Number  33
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL052019
1100 AM EDT Sun Sep 01 2019

Air Force and NOAA reconnaissance planes penetrated the distinct
eye of Dorian, and found that the hurricane has become extremely
intense with a stadium effect in the eye. The NOAA plane reported a
peak flight-level wind of 159 kt, while the SFMR from both planes
have measured winds between 155 and 170 kt.  A dropsonde from the
NOAA plane measured a wind gust of 176 kt at the surface. A blend of
these measurements yield to an initial intensity of 155 kt, making
Dorian the strongest hurricane on record in the northwestern
Bahamas.

For the next few days, Dorian should experience some fluctuations in
intensity, and in addition to eyewall replacement cyclone, the
interaction with the northwestern Bahamas should weaken the
hurricane slightly. After 3 days, as Dorian moves northward along
or offshore of southeast United States coast, the shear is forecast
to increase, resulting in a more distinct gradual weakening.

Reconnaissance plane and satellite fixes indicate that Dorian, as
anticipated, has slowed down and is moving toward the west or 270
degrees at 6 kt. The steering currents are collapsing and Dorian is
expected to slow down even more, prolonging its catastrophic effects
in the northwestern Bahamas. The NHC forecast calls for a slow west
to west-northwest motion during the next 48 hours, with a turn to
the north and an increase in forward speed as the mid-level trough
along the eastern United States deepens and becomes the dominant
steering feature. The current forecast is only a few miles west of
the previous one and is basically on top of the multi-model
consensus. Both the deterministic and consensus tracks have shown
the usual variability to the right or to the left from run to run,
but the overall trend is for the hurricane to turn northward
offshore but very close to the Florida peninsula.

Given the uncertainty in the track forecast and the anticipated
increase in size of the hurricane, a Hurricane Watch and Storm
Surge Watch have been issued for a portion of the east Florida
coast. It is emphasized that although the official track forecast
does not show landfall, users should not focus on the exact track. A
small deviation to the left of the track could bring the intense
core of the hurricane its dangerous winds closer to or onto the
coast.

Key Messages:

1. A prolonged period of catastrophic winds and storm surge will
affect the Abaco Islands today. Everyone there should take immediate
shelter and not venture into the eye. These catastrophic conditions
are likely on Grand Bahama Island later today or tonight, and
efforts to protect life and property there should be rushed to
completion.

2. Storm surge and hurricane watches and tropical storm warnings are
in effect for portions of the Florida east coast. Life-threatening
storm surge and dangerous hurricane-force winds are possible along
portions of the Florida east coast through mid-week, as only a
slight deviation to the left of the official forecast would bring
the core of Dorian near or over the coast. Residents should listen
to advice given by local emergency officials.

3. There is an increasing likelihood of strong winds and dangerous
storm surge along the coasts of Georgia, South Carolina, and North
Carolina later this week. Residents in these areas should continue
to monitor the progress of Dorian.

4. Heavy rains, capable of producing life-threatening flash floods,
are possible over northern portions of the Bahamas and coastal
sections of the southeast and lower mid-Atlantic regions of the
United States through late this week.
